@addtogroup ManagingMemory

When a node allocates memory on the heap and sends the pointer through an output port, the pointer travels to other nodes. The other nodes can hold onto that pointer for any amount of time. There's no guarantee of which node will be the last to use the pointer. Who owns that heap-allocated data? Who is responsible for deallocating it? 

The answer is that the Vuo runtime takes ownership of the data as soon as it leaves the node, and is responsible for deallocating it. The Vuo runtime uses [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) to keep track of heap-allocated memory and deallocate it when all nodes are finished using it.

You need to use Vuo's reference-counting system to manage memory if: 

   - You're implementing a data type that has heap-allocated data.
   - You're implementing a stateful node class. 

Read on to learn how. 



## The reference-counting functions

Vuo provides four functions for reference-counting:

  - VuoRegister() informs the Vuo runtime that the data should be reference counted. When the reference count of the data is decremented back to zero (its original value), the data will be deallocated. This function should be called once on the data. 
  - VuoRetain() increments the data's reference count, informing the Vuo runtime that someone has started using the data. The VuoRegister() function must be called on the data before the first call to VuoRetain(). 
  - VuoRelease() decrements the data's reference count, informing the Vuo runtime that someone has finished using the data. The VuoRetain() function must have been called at least *N* times on the data before the *N*-th call to VuoRelease(). 
  - VuoLocal() is a convenience macro that immediately VuoRetain()s the data, and automatically VuoRelease()s it at the end of the local scope.

When compiling a composition, the Vuo compiler automatically inserts most of the necessary calls to VuoRegister(), VuoRetain(), and VuoRelease(). If you're implementing a stateless node class, you never need to call these functions. If you're implementing a stateful node class or a data type, read on to learn when to call these functions.



## When memory is managed for you

In many cases, you can rely on the data types and the Vuo compiler to handle all the memory management.


### Memory management by data types

By convention, a type function that constructs port data is responsible for registering that data. For example, when you call VuoText_make(), it allocates memory for the @ref VuoText value and calls VuoRegister() on it.


### Memory management by the Vuo compiler

The Vuo compiler automatically inserts calls to VuoRetain() and VuoRelease() based on the type of the port or node instance data. For port data, "type" means its underlying data type, which is `typedef`ed in the type's header file. For node instance data, "type" means the type returned by nodeInstanceInit().

If the data type is a pointer, then VuoRetain() or VuoRelease() is called on the data itself. If the data type is a struct, then VuoRetain() or VuoRelease() is called on each field of the struct that's a pointer, each field of any struct inside the struct that's a pointer, and so on (a recursive traversal). 

Note that the Vuo compiler inserts VuoRetain() and VuoRelease() calls for fields inside a struct but *not* for fields inside a *pointer to* a struct. 

In many cases, the Vuo compiler automatically inserts calls to VuoRetain() and VuoRelease() where needed: 

   - After a call to nodeInstanceInit(), the returned instance data is retained. 
   - After a call to nodeEvent() or nodeInstanceEvent(), for each output port and the instance data, the old data is released and the new data is retained. 
   - After a call to nodeInstanceFini(), the instance data is released. 
   - When port's value changes, the old data is released and the new data is retained. 
   - When a composition is stopped, for each port, the data is released. 


### Example: Sending data through an output port

If you're sending data through an output port, then the memory management is handled by the type and the Vuo compiler. You don't need to call VuoRegister(), VuoRetain(), or VuoRelease().

In the example below, VuoText_makeWithoutCopying() registers `textAsCString` as a @ref VuoText value and returns it. The nodeEvent() function sends this VuoText value through the output port. After the nodeEvent() function returns, the Vuo compiler handles all calls to VuoRetain() and VuoRelease() for the VuoText value. (However, you do have to free `textAsCString`, since it's just a temporary value that never leaves the node.)

@code{.cc}
void nodeEvent
(
	VuoInputData(VuoInteger, {"default":0}) integer,
	VuoOutputData(VuoText) text
)
{
	char *textAsCString = VuoInteger_getString(integer);
	*text = VuoText_makeWithoutCopying(textAsCString);
}
@endcode

The example below is almost the same, except that the output port is a trigger port. 

@code{.cc}
void nodeEvent
(
	VuoInputData(VuoInteger, {"default":0}) integer,
	VuoOutputTrigger(fireText, VuoText)
)
{
	char *textAsCString = VuoInteger_getString(integer);
	fireText( VuoText_makeWithoutCopying(textAsCString) );
}
@endcode



## Managing memory for a data type

If you're implementing a data type, then you may need to add some calls to VuoRegister(), VuoRetain(), and VuoRelease(), depending on how your type uses heap-allocated data.


### Heap-allocated type

If you're defining a data type that's a pointer to heap-allocated data, then your type is responsible for registering that data. For example:

@code{.cc}
typedef char * MyString;

MyString MyString_makeFromJson(json_object * js)
{
	const char *s = "";
	if (json_object_get_type(js) == json_type_string)
		*s = json_object_get_string(js);
	MyString *m = strdup(s);
	VuoRegister(m, free);
	return m;
}
@endcode


### Struct containing a heap-allocated type

If you're defining a data type that's a struct, and the struct contains pointers to heap-allocated data, then your type is responsible for registering that data. For example:

@code{.cc}
typedef struct {
	float *elements;
	size_t elementCount;
} ArrayOfFloats;

ArrayOfFloats ArrayOfFloats_makeFromJson(json_object * js)
{
	ArrayOfFloats a;
	a.elementCount = ...;
	a.elements = (float *)calloc(elementCount, sizeof(float));
	VuoRegister(a.elements, free);
	...;
	return a;
}
@endcode


### Opaque container for a heap-allocated type

If you're defining a data type that's some kind of container than a struct, and it contains pointers to heap-allocated data, then you have to do a little more work. Unlike a struct, the Vuo compiler can't analyze your container to automatically insert calls to VuoRetain() and VuoRelease(). Your type is responsible for registering, retaining, and releasing the items in the container, as well as registering the container itself. For example:

@code{.cc}
typedef VuoText * PairOfStrings;

PairOfStrings PairOfStrings_makeFromJson(json_object * js)
{
	PairOfStrings pair = (PairOfStrings)calloc(2, sizeof(VuoText));
	VuoRegister(pair, PairOfStrings_destroy);
	return pair;
}

void PairOfStrings_destroy(void *p)
{
	PairOfStrings pair = (PairOfStrings)p;
	VuoRelease(pair[0]);
	VuoRelease(pair[1]);	
	free(pair);
}

void PairOfStrings_replaceFirst(PairOfStrings pair, VuoText newFirst)
{
	VuoRetain(newFirst);
	VuoRelease(pair[0]);
	pair[0] = newFirst;
}
@endcode

If instead of @ref VuoText this container held a struct type such as @ref VuoIntegerRange, then you would replace each call to VuoRetain() or VuoRelease() with a call to MyType_retain() or MyType_release(). In fact, you can call MyType_retain() or MyType_release() for any type. These functions are automatically generated by the Vuo compiler (though need to be declared in `MyType.h`). Depending on the underlying data type of `MyType`, they call VuoRetain() and VuoRelease() as needed.



## Managing memory for node instance data

A stateful node class needs to register its instance data before returning it from nodeInstanceInit(). Use VuoRegister(), just like in the examples above for MyType_makeFromJson() in types.

If the instance data is a container for heap-allocated items, then it needs to retain items that it stores and and release items that it no longer stores. Use VuoRetain() and VuoRelease(), just like in the example above for the opaque container type.
