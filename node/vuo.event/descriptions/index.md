These nodes are for working with events. 

**Events** are a fundamental concept in Vuo. They're what make things happen in a composition. For more information, see the <a href="http://vuo.org/manual.pdf">Vuo Manual</a>. 

These nodes fire events in response to certain basic activity as a composition is running, such as when the composition first starts or when the display refreshes. 

To fire events at certain time intervals, see the `vuo.time` node set. 

Many other node sets also have nodes that fire events (for example, in response to activity from a device).
