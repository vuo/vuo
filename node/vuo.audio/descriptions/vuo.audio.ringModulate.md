Multiplies audio channels together.

Connect two or more audio sources to this node â€” a **carrier** channel and one or more **modulator** channels.  Use a low frequency modulator ([Make Audio Wave](vuo-node://vuo.audio.wave2) set below about 20 Hz) to produce a tremolo effect.  Use a high frequency modulator (about 100 Hz to 5,000 Hz) to produce inharmonic, metallic sounds.

The name "ring modulation" comes from the analog circuit implementation of this effect, which uses 4 diodes connected in a ring.  See [this article](http://synthesizeracademy.com/ring-modulator/) for more information.
