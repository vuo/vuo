Calculates a list of points in a rectangle.

   - `X Range`, `Y Range` — The first and last positions to output.
   - `X Curve`, `X Easing`, `Y Curve`, `Y Easing` — The shape of the [easing curve](vuo-nodeset://vuo.motion) that defines how the points are spaced.
   - `X Point Count`, `Y Point Count` — How many points to create along each axis.

Thanks to [Martinus Magneson](https://community.vuo.org/u/MartinusMagneson) for developing the node this is based on.
