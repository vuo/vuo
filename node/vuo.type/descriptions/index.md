These nodes convert between different types of data. 

If you drag a data cable from one port to another port with a different data type, then one of these nodes may be automatically inserted. You also have the option to add these nodes to the composition yourself, for example if you need to do a series of data conversions (from one type to a second type to a third type). 

The data types handled by these nodes include: 

   - **Text**, which is useful for reading and writing. 
   - **Integers** and **real numbers**, which are useful for math. 
   - **Booleans**, which are useful for logic.
