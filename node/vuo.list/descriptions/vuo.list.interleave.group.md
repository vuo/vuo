Combines the items from the input lists into a single output list, alternating between the two lists in groups.

The output list contains some items from `List 1`, followed by some items from `List 2`, followed by some items from `List 1`, and so on.  If the end of a list is reached before the output list is complete, its last item is repeated until reaching a complete set of items for the two groups.

Thanks to [Martinus Magneson](https://community.vuo.org/u/MartinusMagneson) for developing the node this is based on.
