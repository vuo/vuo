These nodes are for routing data and events through a composition. 

To choose between different parts of the composition to execute, use a `Select Output` node. 

To choose between different data and event sources, use a `Select Input` node. 

To coalesce events from different sources, use a `Select Latest` node. 

To block events from one source while letting events from another source pass through, use a `Hold Value` node from the `vuo.data` node set. 

For further explanation of these nodes, see the <a href="http://vuo.org/manual.pdf">Vuo Manual</a>.
