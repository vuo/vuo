Nodes for receiving input from the Behringer BCF2000 MIDI controller.

Upload [one of these SysEx patches](http://softpixel.com/~smokris/widgets/quartzComposer/bcf2000/) to your BCF2000.  You can use [SysEx Librarian](https://www.snoize.com/sysexlibrarian/) to do that.

These nodes also work with [Steamshift's BCF2000 simulator](http://steamshift.uk/#Apps).
