/**
 * Manages the number of threads used by a composition to avoid hitting the Dispatch Thread Soft Limit.
 *
 * When a composition needs to schedule a block of code that may need to wait on stuff, it requests a
 * thread from the thread manager. The thread manager, which manages several thread pools, schedules
 * the block of code when a thread becomes available. When the block of code completes, the composition
 * informs the thread manager, and the thread manager returns the threads to their thread pool.
